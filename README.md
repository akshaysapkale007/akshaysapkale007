## 🎯 What I Do

I build **Level 3 Autonomous Agents**—AI systems that don't just respond to prompts, but autonomously perceive, reason, plan, and execute. I've applied the same agentic architecture across Finance, Marketing, Sales, and Business Intelligence.

> **"If a human can do it with a screen and a keyboard, I can build an agent to do it."**
